<h2>My Projects:</h2>

### Natural Language Processing, LLMs, and Agents

- **[Multi-Agent AI Smart Inventory Management System](https://github.com/omerch54/Multi-Agent-Smart-Inventory-Management-System.git)**  
  An AI-powered warehouse management system using SQLite and AutoGen for real-time inventory tracking, order processing, and task scheduling with intelligent agents.

- **[LangChain Poetry Agent](https://github.com/omerch54/LangChain-Poetry-Agent.git)**  
  A poetry-generating AI that extracts the 10 most frequent words from a document and dynamically constructs poems using LangChain and GPT-4o-mini.

- **[Machine Translation System (Transformer-based)](https://github.com/omerch54/Machine-Translation.git)**  
  A custom neural machine translation model using a Transformer encoder-decoder to translate German to English, trained on the Multi30k dataset.

- **[QA System using Fine-tuned DistilBERT](https://github.com/omerch54/QA-BERT.git)**  
  A DistilBERT-based QA system trained on the Natural Questions dataset to predict answer spans with precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation.

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning

- **[Attention-Based CNN Intensive Sleep Staging Model](https://devpost.com/software/deep-learning-model-for-efficient-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy)**  
  An optimized AttnSleep model for EEG-based sleep stage classification using TensorFlow, achieving 80% accuracy with improved efficiency.

- **[Variational Autoencoders (VAE) & CVAE for Digit Generation](https://devpost.com/software/deep-learning-model-for-efficient-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy)**  
  A TensorFlow implementation of VAE and CVAE for generating MNIST digits, incorporating latent space interpolation and semi-supervised learning.

### Data Science

- **[Passport Index & Economic Indicators Analysis](https://github.com/omerch54/Data-Science-Proj-Passports.git)**  
  A machine learning analysis of the relationship between passport strength and economic factors using clustering and regression models.

- **[Web Scraping for Stock Market Data](https://github.com/omerch54/web-scrapping.git)**  
  A stock market data scraper using BeautifulSoup and SQLite, integrating the STONKS API for real-time financial data analysis.

### Full Stack Development

- **[Sneaker Bargains Website](https://github.com/omerch54/sneaker-bargains.git)**  
  A full-stack Java-React application for real-time sneaker price comparisons from multiple vendors, featuring API integrations and dynamic UI components.

- **[CSV Explorer](https://github.com/omerch54/CSV-explorer.git)**
